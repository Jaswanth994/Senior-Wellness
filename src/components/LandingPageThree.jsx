          Popups like these are classic examples of "clickbait scams" designed to trick users into providing personal information or downloading malware. Here's why this popup is likely a scam:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Excessive Promises of Wealth:</strong> Claims of winning a million dollars with flashy visuals are often too good to be true. Scammers use large cash rewards to lure users into clicking without thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Countdown Timer:</strong> The "ONLY 45 MINUTES LEFT!" message creates a false sense of urgency. Scammers often use timers to pressure people into making quick decisions without considering potential risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Suspicious Button Labels:</strong> Options like "I CLAIM" versus "NO I DONâ€™T WANT FREE MONEY" are designed to manipulate emotions. Genuine websites use clear, neutral options, not emotional prompts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>No Source or Company Information:</strong> Legitimate sweepstakes or rewards are hosted by reputable companies with clear branding. This popup lacks any legitimate company name, making it anonymous and untrustworthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Potential for Phishing and Malware:</strong> Clicking these popups often leads to phishing sites that ask for personal information or initiate harmful downloads.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to Stay Safe:</strong> Avoid clicking on popups with exaggerated promises, countdowns, and unclear sources. Always verify promotions directly through official websites and be cautious with any unsolicited "winning" notifications.
